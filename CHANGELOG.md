## v0.12.0 - unreleased

> TBD

v0.12 brings React 18 support.

- BREAKING: **React 17 and below are no longer supported.** React 18 is the minimum version.
- BREAKING: **IE11 is no longer officially supported** by Remount 0.12 and React 18. If IE support is needed, consider using Remount v0.11 with React 17. Some IE11 workarounds will continue to exist in Remount 0.12, but they will be removed in the next version.
- Add React 18 support. ([#81])
- Fix issue when loading asynchronously in mutation observer mode (eg, IE11). ([#30])
- Internal: update test suite, update Rollup. ([#82], [#88])

## [v0.11.0]

> Apr 22, 2019

v0.11 brings improved create-react-app support!

- Deprecate the `remount/es6` build. Just use the default `remount` build, which is now compatible with create-react-app. ([#12])
- The bundles are now made a bit slimmer. ([#12])
- Add demos in the repo, so you can try Remount in a sandbox. ([#12])

v0.10 brings improved Shadow DOM support, and Rails Webpacker support!

- Fix compatibility with Webpacker by making the main export `.js` instead of `.mjs`. ([#11])
- Deprecate importing using `import remount from 'remount/esm'` - just use `'remount'` instead. ([#11])
